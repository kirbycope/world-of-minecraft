World of Warcraft but in Minecraft

## Original Map - [Creatring Azeroth](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/show-your-creation/screenshots/1595918-crafting-azeroth)
I loaded the map and tried to find the coordinates using [Minecraft Overviewer]([https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/show-your-creation/screenshots/1595918-crafting-azeroth](https://overviewer.org/warcraft/#/4692/64/9805/max/0/0)). I eventually found Northshire Abbey at ~ `3740 89 8890`. Using [F3] I found the chunk to be `r.7.117`. I created a new void world save and replaced the "region" directory's contents with just `r.7.17.mca`

## Editing World Data
I used [Universal Minecraft Editor](https://www.universalminecrafteditor.com/) to edit a new save to become the starter for this repo. Mainly I changed the starting coordinates to be `3740 89 8890`.

## NPCS
I created a resourcepack to replace the textures for Villagers.

### Stormwind Guard
Based off of [this player skin](https://www.minecraftskins.com/skin/10923287/edit-of-stormwind-guard/) from [Goontthebest](https://www.minecraftskins.com/profile/2925112/goontthebest).

   - [Nitwit.png](/World%20of%20Minecraft/resourcepacks/world-of-minecraft/assets/minecraft/textures/entity/villager/profession/nitwit.png) make all Nitwits into Stormwind Guards with helmets
